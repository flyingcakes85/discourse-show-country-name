# discourse-show-country-name
A Firefox addon to show country names against users on Discourse forums

### Should I publish this on the addons store?

## Installation
This is currently not on the addons store, so you'll have to manually install it.

 1. Clone this repository
 2. Open your browser and navigate to about:debugging
 3. Under the 'This Firefox' tab, click on 'Load Temporary Add-on'
 4. navigate to where you cloned this repository and select manifest.json
 5. Now when you are on a Discourse forum, right click anywhere and select 'Show Countries' to append the country name after each username. This works only if the user has set a country.

This is my first practical application. The code might look like its written by a n00b.
